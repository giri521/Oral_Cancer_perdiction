# 🏥 Oral Cancer Detection System  
> **AI-powered web application for detecting oral cancer using deep learning.**  

![Oral Cancer Detection](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300?text=Oral+Cancer+Detection+System)  

## 📌 Overview  
The **Oral Cancer Detection System** helps detect oral cancer from images of oral lesions using a trained deep learning model (CNN).  

## ✨ Features  
✅ Upload oral lesion images for real-time cancer detection  
✅ Classifies images as benign or malignant  
✅ Uses OpenCV for image preprocessing  
✅ Provides instant results with confidence scores  
✅ User-friendly web interface  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend:** Python, Flask  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Pandas, Numpy  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1️⃣ Upload an image of an oral lesion  
2️⃣ System preprocesses the image using OpenCV  
3️⃣ CNN model predicts if the lesion is benign or malignant  
4️⃣ Results are displayed with confidence scores
